# Embedded_Potentiostat
This project mainly focuses on the development and testing of an embedded potentiostat system that can perform electrochemistry methods like Cyclic voltammetry, Square wave voltammetry, Differential pulse voltammetry, and Impedance spectroscopy.
This project includes the circuit design and PCB design of a potentiostat and power supply using Eagle Autodesk software.
The software implementation includes driver development for SPI, UART, TIMERS, DACs, and ADCs of the STM32F303ZETx microcontroller using STM32cubeIDE as well as Eclipse IDE. Along with driver development, electrochemical methods and digital signal processing methods were implemented using a microcontroller and Matlab.
Moreover, a graphic user interface (GUI) was implemented using C# and Visual Studio to automate the measurement process of the developed potentiostat.
